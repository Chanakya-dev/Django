### Example: Creating a Basic View with `HttpResponse`

### Step 1: Define the View

Instead of using `render()`, we will use `HttpResponse` to return a basic text response.

```python
# users/views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    # This view will return a simple response
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Welcome to the Home Page!")
```

### Step 2: Create a URL Pattern for the View

Just like before, we need to create a URL pattern for this view in the app's `urls.py`.

```python
# users/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),  # Map the 'home' view to the root URL ('/')
]
```

### Step 3: Register the URL in the Projectâ€™s `urls.py`

Register the app's `urls.py` in the main project `urls.py`.

```python
# mysite/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('users.urls')),  # Include the 'users' app URLs
]
```

### Step 4: Testing the View

1. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Visit the URL**:
   Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

You should see the message: `Hello, Welcome to the Home Page!`.
